# EDGAR Python Data Pipeline

This project ingests, cleans, and organizes securities filings provided by the SEC. The SEC requires all companies to file reports and statements through their EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) system. The SEC provides programmatic access to their system up to 10 requests/second. For more information, see [Accessing EDGAR Data](https://www.sec.gov/os/accessing-edgar-data).
